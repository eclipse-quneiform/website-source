### Features for Developers

*Eclipse Quneiform*&reg; provides numerous tools for analyzing your project at every stage of internationalization.
At the initial stage, *Quneiform* will analyze your source code to uncover various problems.
This can include issues such as function misuse, strings not exposed for translation, etc.

At the next stage of i18n, resource catalogs can be analyzed to find issues with the translatable content.
Issues here can include confusing messages, concatenated string, and strings that probably shouldnâ€™t be in the resources.

Once your resource catalogs are ready, *Quneiform* can pseudo-translate them for integration testing.
During pseudo-translation testing, display issues, missing content, and even program instability can be uncovered.
By performing these tests, your product will be l10n ready before translator hand-off, saving both time and money.
