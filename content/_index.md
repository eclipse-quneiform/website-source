## About

*Eclipse Quneiform*^®^ is free & open source software for analyzing applications for internationalization and localization issues.
It can review both your source code and resource files to detect an array of problems.

At the source code level, issues such as untranslatable strings or translations being concatenated can be uncovered.
Likewise, translation catalogs can be reviewed for problems such as mismatching format commands, numbers, and keyboard accelerators.

By reporting these issues, *Quneiform* can help you ensure that your software is localization ready.
Additionally, it can provide an extra layer of quality assurance to your translation review process.
